- Defined as the **delivery of *cloud computing services* over the internet**
	- *Cloud computing services* include:
		- [[Virtual Machines]]
		- [[Storage]]
		- Databases
		- Networking
		- Internet of Things
		- Machine Learning
		- Artificial Intelligence
-
- Because this service is delivered over the internet, it doesn't have to be constrained by physical infrastructure
-
- Cloud computing operates on the [shared responsibility model]([[Shared Responsibility Model]]) as well as the [operational expenditure model]([[Operational Expenditure Model]])
-
- There are ***four* main types of cloud models**:
  |||Public cloud|Multi-cloud|Hybrid cloud|Private cloud|
  |Summary||Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider|Multiple public clouds|Both public/private clouds used together|Cloud used by/dedicated to a single entity|
  |Maintainer||Provider|Providers|Provider and consumer|Consumer|
  |Cost||\$|$|\$$|$$$|
  |Security & Resources||Only options given by the provider|Only options given by the providers|Consumer decides who has control|Consumer has full control|
	- **Azure Arc**
	  id:: 648b5920-6fbe-4751-913c-31dfe245caef
		- A set of technologies that can help manage these types of models
		- Allows for a consistent development and operation experience to run cloud-native apps anywhere
		- Provides Azure security and governance for applications, data, and infrastructure across environments
	- **Azure VMware Solution**
		- Allows private cloud VMware workloads to be run in Azure
-
- **When building a cloud application**, there are ***two* big considerations**:
	- Availability (***uptime***)
		- When architecting a solution, you'll need to account for service availability guarantees
			- These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs)
	- Ability to handle demand (***scale***)
		- Because the cloud works off of the [operational expenditure model]([[Operational Expenditure Model]]), you only pay for what you use
			- This means that you can reduce your resources if demand is low, or add more if demand is high
		- There are ***two* types of scaling** when adjusting the amount of cloud resources
			- *Vertical scaling* refers to adding more resources to existing infrastructure (i.e. adding more CPUs and RAM to a virtual machine)
			- *Horizontal scaling* refers to deploying new infrastructure (i.e. adding more virtual machines)
-
- **Confidence in the cloud** comes from ***two* crucial benefits**:
	- ***Reliability*** (the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function)
		- Because the cloud is decentralized, you can have resources deployed in regions around the world
			- In the event of a failure, your cloud environment itself can shift to a different region with no action needed
	- ***Predictability***
		- *Performance Predictability* (predicting the amount of resources needed)
			- Autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet demand, then scale back when demand drops
			- Load balancing can help redirect traffic to a different area if an area is overloaded
		- *Cost Predictability* (predicting the cost of the cloud spend)
			- You can track your resources in real time and monitor them to ensure they are being used in the most efficient way
			- You can also apply data analytics to to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments
			- You can use tools such as the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend
-
- Another major benefit of cloud computing is manageability. There are ***two* types of manageability** in the cloud:
	- **Management of the cloud** (managing your cloud resources), which includes:
		- *Automatically scaling resource deployment* based on need
		- *Deploying resources based on a template* (removing the need for manual configuration)
		- *Monitoring the health of resources* and automatically replacing failing ones
		- *Receiving automatic alerts* based on configured metrics, so you can be aware of performance in real time
	- **Management in the cloud** (how you manage your cloud environment), which includes:
		- Through a *web portal*
		- Using a *command line interface*
		- Using *APIs*
		- Using *PowerShell*
