	- Defined as the delivery of cloud computing services over the internet
		- Cloud computing services include:
			- [[Virtual Machines]]
			- [[Storage]]
			- Databases
			- Networking
			- Internet of Things
			- Machine Learning
			- Artificial Intelligence
	- Because this service is delivered over the internet, it doesn't have to be constrained by physical infrastructure
	- Cloud computing operates on the [shared responsibility model]([[Shared Responsibility Model]]) as well as the [operational expenditure model]([[Operational Expenditure Model]])
	- There are four main types of cloud models:
	  |||Public cloud|Multi-cloud|Hybrid cloud|Private cloud|
	  |Summary||Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider|Multiple public clouds|Both public/private clouds used together|Cloud used by/dedicated to a single entity|

	  |Cost||\$|$|\$$|$$$|
	  |Security & Resources||Only options given by the provider|Only options given by the providers|Consumer decides who has control|Consumer has full control|
		- ## Azure Arc
			- A set of technologies that can help manage these types of models
			- Allows for a consistent development and operation experience to run cloud-native apps anywhere
			- Provides Azure security and governance for applications, data, and infrastructure across environments
		- ## Azure VMware Solution
			- Allows private cloud VMware workloads to be run in Azure
