- The operational expenditure model (or OpEx) refers to spending money on services or products over time
- Cloud computing falls under OpEx because it is a consumption-based modelâ€”you only pay for the IT resources you use
- Benefits of the operational expenditure model include:
	- No upfront costs
	- No need to purchase costly infrastructure that users may not even use
	- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed
	- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
