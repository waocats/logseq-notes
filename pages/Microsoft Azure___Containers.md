-
- **A lighter-weight virtualization environment than virtual machines, as *they virtualize the OS, not the hardware* **
-
- Unlike virtual machines, you do not manage the operating system for a container
-
- **Containers are designed to allow you to *respond to changes on demand* and for being *created*, *scaled out*, and *stopped* dynamically**
	- Applications can be broken up into parts (frontend, backend, database, etc.) and specific parts can be scaled for increased performance
